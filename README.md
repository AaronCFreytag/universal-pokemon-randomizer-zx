Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX Advent

This is a fork of Pokemon Randomizer ZX which has some additional changes designed for a bit less of a crazy random experience while still retaining randomization elements. These changes also include various QOL settings and new features.

Notable differences:
- Pokemon statline swapping, with associated pokemon evolution method swapping
- "Augmented" type randomization, which will infrequently add a secondary type to a monotype evolution line
- Tweaked same-type move learning probability to be more biased towards a pokemon's type(s) and normal type moves
- (Currently extremely limited) Pokemon Showdown mod file export

These features have not yet been extensively tested ingame so the stability of this version is somewhat unknown.
NOTE: Settings will not be compatible between this version and the main version

# Purpose
The purpose of this fork was originally to fix minor issues, and to rebalance/change some things. As such, you might find that some of the things that are changed are not necessarily _better,_ but rather just different. Regardless, these changes have the goal of making the randomizer more fun to play, so hopefully you (the person reading this) find the changes to be good.

The fork has since then become a bit more ambitious, adding new features and support for new games. Additions/updates will still be done at my discretion, so don't contact me to tell me to add things to the randomizer. However, if you find something that seems to be a bug, feel free to submit an issue. Thanks!
